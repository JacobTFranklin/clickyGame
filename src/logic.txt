-Every image (card) needs to be clickable
- Upon clicking an image, the following should happen:
    -Shuffle of images
    -Determine if it has or has not been clicked
        -if it has, clear score, dispay 'you guessed incorrectly', start game over 
            -starting game over resets the score, shuffles
        -if it hasn't, add 1 to the score, display 'you guessed correctly' , shuffle images
- Scores should be pushed to an array
    -highest value of the array displayed as the top score
